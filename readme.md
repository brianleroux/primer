# tmp hackspace for a topcoat app

# dev

- run `grunt` on a tab to start watching/rebuilding www
- js is in lib
- css is in www/index.css (and www/vendor/topcoat)
- html is in www

# deploying to gh-pages

run `grunt gh-pages`


# todo

- x.js output is not minified
- mixing build artifacts (x.js) with code (index.css) with framework (vendor/topcoat) smells funny
